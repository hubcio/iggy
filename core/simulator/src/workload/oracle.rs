//! Quiesce-time cross-replica oracle (workload Phase C).
//!
//! The per-tick invariants in [`super::invariants`] catch a regression on a
//! single replica. This adds the post-drain checks. [`assert_converged`]
//! asserts two things that must hold:
//!
//! - no live replica is ahead of the leader on any namespace (a backup ahead of
//!   the leader is a split-brain / divergence bug),
//! - every live replica agrees with every other on each committed metadata op
//!   they both hold, the real consensus property (see
//!   [`super::state_checker`]),
//! - on a serial run, the workload's predicted [`Shadow`] equals the metadata
//!   committed on the leader, the payoff of the name-keyed shadow.
//!
//! Equality is asserted over the committed PREFIX, not over equal heads: a replica
//! that missed the last commit broadcast, or rejoined recently, may legitimately
//! trail. What it may not do is hold different history at an op it did commit.
//! Requiring equal heads would fail on ordinary lag and say nothing about safety.
