//! Deterministic workload fuzzer for the Iggy simulator.
//!
//! Drives [`simulator::workload::run_with_faults`] (per-tick invariants plus
//! crash, restart and network fault injection) for a number of ticks, then
//! optionally quiesces and asserts the Phase C consensus checks. Everything is a
//! function of `--seed`, logged at start and on panic so any failure replays
//! with `--seed <value>`.
//!
//! ```text
//! workload-fuzz [--seed N] [--ticks N] [--clients N] [--replicas N]
//!               [--plane partition|metadata|mixed|uniform]
//!               [--faults none|light|heavy|swarm] [--no-quiesce]
//!               [--crash-prob F] [--restart-prob F] [--crash-primary]
//!               [network overrides: --packet-loss-prob, --replay-prob, --partition-mode,
//!                --partition-prob, --unpartition-prob, --clog-prob, ...]
//! ```
//!
//! `--plane` selects the op mix (see [`ActionWeights`]). Partition-plane runs drain
//! and converge most readily; `uniform` is the widest per-tick op coverage.
//!
//! `--faults` picks a whole network fault profile, and the individual network flags
//! override single fields of it, so exploring one axis does not mean spelling out
//! the other ten. The default is `none`, a perfect network, so a run says what it
//! injects rather than inheriting it.
//!
//! `--faults swarm` derives every network parameter from `--seed`, which is what a
//! CI campaign wants: `none`/`light`/`heavy` are three points in parameter space,
//! so a thousand seeds against `heavy` is the same network a thousand times. The
//! drawn values print on the `network:` line and `--seed` replays them exactly.
//!
//! Exit codes: `0` passed, `2` the configuration is unusable, `3` the run proved
//! nothing because a vacuity floor went unmet, and `101` an invariant or an oracle
//! failed. Only `101` is a bug. A campaign that cannot tell `3` from `101` reports
//! its own thin seeds as failures, which is what splitting them apart is for.
