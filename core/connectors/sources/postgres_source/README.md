# PostgreSQL Source Connector

The PostgreSQL source connector fetches data from PostgreSQL databases and streams it to Iggy topics. It supports table polling and Change Data Capture (CDC) modes with flexible payload extraction.

## Features

- **Table Polling**: Incrementally fetch data from PostgreSQL tables
- **Change Data Capture**: Monitor database changes using PostgreSQL logical replication
- **Flexible Payload Extraction**: Extract BYTEA, TEXT, or JSONB columns directly as payload
- **Custom Queries**: Use custom SQL queries with parameter substitution
- **Delete After Read**: Automatically delete rows after processing
- **Mark as Processed**: Mark rows as processed using a boolean column
- **Multiple Tables**: Monitor multiple tables simultaneously
- **Batch Processing**: Fetch data in configurable batch sizes
- **Offset Tracking**: Resume incremental polling from the last acknowledged offset

## Configuration

## Delivery Failures

Each batch selected by the polling query is delivered at least once, so
consumers must tolerate duplicates. Complete polling capture additionally
requires transactions to become visible in tracking-column order. A transaction
that commits below an already acknowledged cursor is not selected by a later
poll, even when the tracking column is unique. A failed send NACKs the batch and
leaves its database progress uncommitted for redelivery.
After five consecutive NACKs, the source stops and requires a manual connector
restart.

Cleanup work and replication-slot advances are stored with the acknowledged
checkpoint before they run. After a restart, the connector replays that work
before polling new rows and then saves a state-only checkpoint to retire it.
Checkpoints created by older connector versions remain compatible unless they
contain unfinished row cleanup without the row-version receipt required for
safe replay. In that case, verify the affected rows and clear the connector
state before restarting.

## Output Modes

### JSON Mode (Default)

When `payload_column` is not set, each row is wrapped in a `DatabaseRecord` JSON structure:

```json
{
  "table_name": "users",
  "operation_type": "SELECT",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "old_data": null
}
```

The stream config should use `schema = "json"`.

### Payload Column Extraction

When `payload_column` is set, the connector extracts that column directly as the Iggy message payload. The `payload_format` option determines how the column is read:

| Format | Column Type | Schema | Description |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `bytea` / `raw` | `BYTEA` | `raw` | Raw bytes passthrough |
| `text` | `TEXT` | `text` | UTF-8 text |
| `json_direct` / `jsonb` | `JSONB` | `json` | JSON object serialized to bytes |

## Payload Format Examples

### BYTEA (Raw Bytes)

Extract raw bytes from a BYTEA column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE message_queue (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    payload BYTEA NOT NULL
);
```

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "messages"
topic = "queue"
schema = "raw"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
tables = ["message_queue"]
tracking_column = "id"
payload_column = "payload"
payload_format = "bytea"
```

### TEXT

Extract text from a TEXT column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "logs"
topic = "app_logs"
schema = "text"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
tables = ["logs"]
tracking_column = "id"
payload_column = "message"
payload_format = "text"
```

### JSONB (Direct)

Extract JSONB directly as JSON payload (without `DatabaseRecord` wrapper):

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data JSONB NOT NULL
);
```

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "events"
topic = "user_events"
schema = "json"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
tables = ["events"]
tracking_column = "id"
payload_column = "data"
payload_format = "json_direct"
```

## Custom Query Parameters

When using `custom_query`, these placeholders are available:

| Placeholder | Replaced With |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| `$table` | Current table name |
| `$offset` | Last processed offset (or `initial_offset`) |
| `$limit` | `batch_size` value |
| `$now` | Current UTC timestamp (RFC3339) |
| `$now_unix` | Current Unix timestamp (seconds) |

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM $table
WHERE created_at > $offset
  AND (scheduled_at IS NULL OR scheduled_at <= '$now')
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT $limit
```

Custom queries containing `$offset` advance the connector-managed offset after
the batch is acknowledged. The tracking column must be unique and non-null, and
the query must return rows ordered by that column in ascending order. Custom
queries without `$offset` do not advance the connector-managed offset. Cleanup
operations remain bounded by the selected primary keys rather than by the custom
query's cursor. When cleanup is enabled, the query result must include the
resolved cleanup key. The connector joins the result to the configured source
table in the same PostgreSQL snapshot to capture each selected row's version.

The generated polling query also uses this scalar cursor. At startup, the
connector rejects any generated query or `$offset` custom query whose tracking
column lacks a valid single-column unique index or permits null values.

## Delete After Read / Mark as Processed

Both options may be present for compatibility. When `delete_after_read` is
`true`, rows are deleted and `processed_column` is ignored.

The resolved cleanup key is `primary_key_column`, or `tracking_column` when the
former is unset. For every configured table, it must be a non-null column with
a valid single-column unique index. The connector validates this requirement
at startup before enabling delete or mark operations.
The resolved key, tracking column, cleanup action, and selected row versions are
stored in the acknowledged checkpoint. A restart rejects incompatible cleanup
configuration instead of applying old work to a different column or action.

### Delete After Read

Deletes rows from the source table only after Iggy acknowledges the batch:

```toml
[plugin_config]
delete_after_read = true
primary_key_column = "id"
```

### Mark as Processed

Updates a boolean column after Iggy acknowledges the batch instead of deleting:

```toml
[plugin_config]
processed_column = "is_processed"
primary_key_column = "id"
```

Your table needs the boolean column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

When `processed_column` is set, the connector automatically adds a `WHERE is_processed = FALSE` filter to the polling query, so only unprocessed rows are fetched. This improves polling efficiency as the table grows.

With the generated polling query, a row whose tracking value moves past the
batch boundary between poll and acknowledgement is left unchanged and returns
in a later poll. Custom queries do not apply this boundary because their result
order is not guaranteed. Cleanup also matches the row version captured by the
poll, so replay cannot delete or mark a replacement row that reused the same
key.

For generated polling queries, the connector persists the acknowledged offset
before deleting or marking rows. If it stops in between, the rows have been
delivered but may remain unchanged in PostgreSQL. The persisted offset prevents
those rows from being selected again.

## Supported Column Types

The connector handles these PostgreSQL types in JSON mode:

| PostgreSQL Type | JSON Output |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `BOOL` | boolean |
| `INT2`, `INT4`, `INT8` | number |
| `FLOAT4`, `FLOAT8` | number |
| `NUMERIC` | string (exact decimal representation) |
| `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `CHAR` | string |
| `TIMESTAMP`, `TIMESTAMPTZ` | string (RFC3339) |
| `UUID` | string |
| `JSON`, `JSONB` | object |
| `BYTEA` | base64 string |
| Other | string (fallback) |

## CDC Mode

CDC requires PostgreSQL 11 or newer and logical replication setup:

1. Set `wal_level = logical` in `postgresql.conf`
2. Restart PostgreSQL
3. Use a direct connection (no pooler)

```toml
[plugin_config]
mode = "cdc"
tables = ["users", "orders"]
capture_operations = ["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]
```

The connector peeks at logical changes and advances the replication slot only
after Iggy acknowledges the batch. A failed delivery leaves the slot unchanged
so the next poll can read the same changes again.

Advancing the slot fast-forwards through the WAL range that was just peeked, so
each acknowledged batch is decoded twice. Poll and decode errors do not change
the connector's runtime status. Monitor `confirmed_flush_lsn`, retained WAL, and
replication slot lag in PostgreSQL to detect a stuck CDC poller.

The `pg_replicate` backend requires the `cdc_pg_replicate` feature flag at build time.

### Slot Naming

Each CDC connector must use a unique `replication_slot`. Setup accepts any
pre-existing `test_decoding` slot, so two connectors pointed at the same
database with the default `replication_slot = "iggy_slot"` will silently
share one slot. Each connector peeks from and advances the same slot after
delivery, so one connector can move the shared position past changes that the
other has not processed.
Set an explicit, distinct `replication_slot` per connector instance.

### Decommissioning

A replication slot retains WAL for as long as it exists, regardless of
whether a connector is still consuming it (`max_slot_wal_keep_size` defaults
to `-1`, i.e. unbounded). Dropping a connector without dropping its slot
leaves an orphaned slot that accumulates WAL indefinitely and can fill the
disk. When decommissioning a CDC connector, drop its slot:

```sql
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('iggy_slot');
```

## Example Configs

### Basic Polling (JSON Mode)

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "user_events"
topic = "users"
schema = "json"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
connection_string = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
mode = "polling"
tables = ["users"]
poll_interval = "1s"
tracking_column = "updated_at"
```

### Raw Payload Passthrough

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "messages"
topic = "queue"
schema = "raw"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
connection_string = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
mode = "polling"
tables = ["message_queue"]
poll_interval = "100ms"
tracking_column = "id"
payload_column = "payload"
payload_format = "bytea"
delete_after_read = true
```

### JSONB Direct Extraction

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "events"
topic = "user_events"
schema = "json"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
connection_string = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
mode = "polling"
tables = ["events"]
poll_interval = "1s"
tracking_column = "id"
payload_column = "data"
payload_format = "json_direct"
```

### CDC with Custom Operations

```toml
[[streams]]
stream = "audit"
topic = "changes"
schema = "json"
batch_length = 100

[plugin_config]
connection_string = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
mode = "cdc"
tables = ["users", "orders"]
capture_operations = ["INSERT", "UPDATE"]
```

## Reliability Features

### Automatic Retries

The connector automatically retries transient database errors (connection issues, deadlocks, serialization failures) with linear backoff. Configure with `max_retries` (default: 3) and `retry_delay` (default: `1s`). The actual delay is `retry_delay * attempt_number`. Non-transient errors fail immediately.

Polling operations use the complete configured retry schedule. Database work performed after an ACK, such as deleting or marking rows and advancing a replication slot, uses the same schedule but shares a 10-second deadline across the batch. When the configured schedule exceeds that window, unfinished ACK operations remain staged and are retried before the connector polls new rows.

ACK statements use a transaction-local 9-second server-side timeout so a stalled backend is cancelled before the 10-second ACK callback backstop expires. Polling and CDC reads retain the PostgreSQL connection's configured timeout.

The connector stops after three consecutive row-cleanup or replication-slot advance failures. This prevents permanent cleanup errors from stalling polling while the connector continues to report healthy progress, and prevents repeated CDC delivery while WAL continues to grow.

### SQL Injection Protection

All table names, column names, and identifiers are properly quoted to prevent SQL injection attacks. User-provided values in tracking offsets are also safely escaped.

## Usage with Sink Connector

The source and sink connectors can work together for pass-through scenarios:

### Raw Bytes Pass-through

1. **Sink** with `payload_format = "bytea"` stores messages as BYTEA
2. **Source** with `payload_column = "payload"` and `payload_format = "bytea"` reads them back

### JSON Pass-through

1. **Sink** with `payload_format = "json"` stores messages as JSONB
2. **Source** with `payload_column = "payload"` and `payload_format = "json_direct"` reads JSONB directly

### Flat-Schema Sinks (Iceberg, Delta)

In the default JSON mode (no `payload_column`), the Postgres source wraps each row in a
`DatabaseRecord` envelope containing `table_name`, `operation_type`, `timestamp`, `data`, and
`old_data`. Sinks like Iceberg and Delta expect flat JSON matching the target table schema, so
the envelope must be unwrapped before the data reaches the sink.

**Option A — use the `unwrap_envelope` transform** on the sink side to extract the `data` field:

```toml
[transforms.unwrap_envelope]
enabled = true
field = "data"
```

**Option B — bypass the envelope** by configuring the source with `payload_column` and
`payload_format = "json_direct"` to emit raw JSONB directly (see Payload Column Extraction above).
