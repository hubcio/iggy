# Writing an Apache Iggy Connector Source

A **source** is a Rust `cdylib` that implements
`iggy_connector_sdk::Source` and exposes FFI symbols via the
`source_connector!` macro. The runtime calls `poll()` in a loop,
applies transforms, encodes via the configured `Schema`, sends to
Apache Iggy, and persists the returned `ConnectorState` after every
successful send.

## STOP and ask the user before

- Changing the SDK trait surface (`Source::open` / `poll` / `on_batch_result` / `close`) - that's an SDK change.
- Adding a long-running side task in the plugin - the runtime owns lifecycle, and orphans survive `close()`. Sanctioned only where the source is itself a server the runtime cannot drive, as in `http_source`'s listener, and then only with an explicit shutdown in the last `close()` that awaits its tasks before returning.
- Persisting unbounded state - `State` is rewritten every batch.
- Adding a source that requires authoritative offsets external to Apache Iggy without coordinating retention.

## Quick reference

- Skeleton: [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) (load on demand).
- Exemplars: `random_source` (minimal + canonical state tests), `postgres_source` (cursor / delete-after-read / processed-column modes, restart-survives-state tests), `elasticsearch_source` (scroll cursor), `influxdb_source` (time-series scan).

## Hard rules

### `poll()` signature is `&self`

The macro shares the source as `Arc<T>` across the FFI callback and forwarding loop. Signature: `async fn poll(&self) -> ...` - any mutable state behind `tokio::sync::Mutex`. **Single most common new-contributor mistake.**

### Lock discipline

Never hold the state `Mutex` across upstream I/O. Build a candidate from committed
state, then stage it until the runtime reports the batch result:

```rust
let mut candidate = self.state.lock().await.clone();
let rows = client.query(&sql, &[&candidate.cursor]).await?;
candidate.cursor = Some(new_cursor);
let persisted = ConnectorState::serialize(&candidate, CONNECTOR_NAME, self.id)
    .ok_or_else(|| Error::Serialization("failed to serialize source state".into()))?;
*self.pending.lock().await = Some(candidate);
```

### Delivery acknowledgment

`on_batch_result` (added by #3855) is how a source learns what happened to the batch it just
returned. The SDK keeps exactly one batch in flight: it will not call `poll()` again until this
returns, and it stops the source after `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_NACKS` (5) consecutive NACKs, roughly 1.5s
of backoff, without calling `close()`.

- `Ack` means the runtime sent the batch **and** persisted its state. `Nack` means it could not
  confirm both, which is **not** the same as neither happening: a batch that reached the topic but
  whose state save failed is NACKed, and the SDK NACKs on its own result timeout while the send may
  still have landed. A source that replays on `Nack` is at-least-once, not exactly-once.
- The trait has a **default no-op**, which suits only a source with no staged cursor and no
  destructive work. If `poll()` advances a cursor, deletes rows, or drains an in-memory buffer,
  omitting this loses data silently and nothing will tell you. `random_source` and `http_source`
  implement it; the other shipped sources take the default and skip rows on a NACK.
- Stage in `poll()`, apply on `Ack`, discard or replay on `Nack`. A source whose input is pushed to
  it, rather than re-readable upstream, has to hold the batch itself: see `http_source`'s staging.
- Returning `Err` from it stops the source immediately, so it is not a retry signal.

### State persistence

- `ConnectorState` is `Vec<u8>` via MessagePack (`rmp_serde`). Use
  `ConnectorState::serialize(&state, NAME, id)` and
  `ConnectorState::deserialize::<State>(NAME, id)`.
- `poll()` must not commit cursors or destructive work. Return messages with candidate state and
  keep the corresponding work staged.
- The runtime sends the batch, saves its candidate state to
  `{state_path}/source_{key}.state`, then calls `on_batch_result(Ack)`. Commit staged in-memory
  state and external delete or mark operations only on ACK. A NACK discards the candidate so the
  same data can be polled again.
- A crash between `poll()` returning and state persistence leaves the prior cursor for the next
  poll, so downstream must tolerate at-least-once delivery.
- Cursor sources that stage state until `on_batch_result` can attach state to the corresponding
  message batch. Control-plane state that is independent of a publish can ride an empty batch
  instead.
- Return `state: None` for an empty poll when no watermark changed. If an empty poll advances a
  watermark, stage and return the new state through the same ACK handshake.
- The runtime can still NACK an empty batch when state storage is latched or a pending checkpoint
  cannot resolve. Never treat hand-off as durable; `on_batch_result` reports the outcome.
- Treat candidate-state serialization failure as a poll error. Do not send messages without the
  state needed to resume them safely.
- Keep `State` small - rewritten every batch. No unbounded vecs.

The SDK allows one in-flight batch. Five consecutive NACKs stop the source and
require a manual restart. Returning `Err` from `on_batch_result` is fatal, so
retry transient backend failures inside the callback before returning an error.
The runtime must report ACK or NACK within the SDK's 30-second batch-result
window. Once the result is received, the SDK waits for `on_batch_result` to
finish, so the callback must bound its own connection acquisition and retry
budget rather than relying on the SDK deadline.

### Sleep first

`poll()` must `sleep(self.poll_interval).await` before any work. Without it, an empty source spins a CPU.

### Schema selection

Match `ProducedMessages.schema` to the bytes in `messages[i].payload`:

- JSON-serialized rows → `Schema::Json`
- Already-protobuf bytes → `Schema::Proto`
- Already-avro bytes → `Schema::Avro`
- Opaque → `Schema::Raw`

### IDs and timestamps

- `ProducedMessage.id: Option<u128>` - set when a natural ID exists (DB PK, document id). It rides the wire as the message id, which is what a **consumer** can dedupe an at-least-once duplicate on.
- **Iggy itself does not dedupe on that id.** The server's only read of the field is `core/server/src/http/wire.rs`, which mints a fresh uuid when the incoming id is 0 and otherwise passes it through. Its dedup path is a per-client request-id watermark (`dedup_clients_max`) that never looks at this field.
- `origin_timestamp: Option<u64>` - source-system event time in nanoseconds. Lets downstream sinks reason about lag.
- `timestamp` and `checksum` are Iggy-side - leave `None`.

### Concurrency

- Runtime spawns ONE `poll()` task per source. No concurrent `poll()`.
- Don't spawn your own long-running Tokio tasks: the runtime owns lifecycle. The exception is a source that listens rather than polls, which has to own its listener; `http_source` is the worked example, and it shuts its tasks down in the last `close()` rather than leaving them to outlive the connector.

### Errors

| Scenario                                    | Variant                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Bad config in `new()`/`open()`              | `Error::InitError`                                |
| Cannot reach external system at startup     | `Error::InitError` or `Error::Connection`         |
| Transient fetch failure (retry-worthy)      | `Error::Connection` or `Error::HttpRequestFailed` |
| Permanent fetch failure (auth, schema gone) | `Error::PermanentHttpError`                       |
| Row failed to serialize                     | `Error::Serialization(...)`                       |
| State serialization failed                  | `Error::Serialization(...)`                       |

Returning `Err` from `poll()` is only logged by the SDK's FFI bridge
(`sdk/src/source.rs::handle_messages`) - the loop continues, the next
`poll()` runs. Connector status does NOT flip to `Error` from a poll
failure. Status `Error` is set by the runtime only on transform/encode
failure, Iggy send failure, or state save failure
(`runtime/src/source.rs::source_forwarding_loop` calls to
`context.sources.set_error`). To surface a poll failure as unhealth,
raise it through the metric counter or escalate to `Error::InitError`
from `open()`.

### Logging

```rust
info!("Opened <connector> connector ID: {}, endpoint: {}", self.id, ...);
info!("Restored state for <connector> ID: {id}, cursor: {:?}", ...);
debug!("Polled {} rows for <connector> ID: {}", rows.len(), self.id);
warn!("Transient fetch failure for <connector> ID: {}, will retry: {error}", self.id);
error!("Failed to <op> for <connector> ID: {}, error: {error}", self.id);
info!("Closed <connector> connector ID: {}, total produced: {}", self.id, ...);
```

Iggy consumer-loop labels use literal API names (`offset=`, `current_offset=`).

## Common pitfalls

1. `async fn poll(&mut self)` - won't compile. Use `&self` + `Mutex<State>`.
2. Holding `state.lock()` across the fetch I/O - blocks `close()`, causes shutdown timeouts.
3. Forgetting to sleep - 100% CPU on idle source.
4. Committing a cursor or deleting source data in `poll()` - stage it and wait for ACK.
5. Unbounded data in `State` - rewritten every batch. keep O(constant).
6. `std::sync::Mutex` - blocks the executor. Use `tokio::sync::Mutex`.
7. Not setting `ProducedMessage.id` when a stable ID exists - leaves a consumer nothing to dedupe a replayed duplicate on. It does not make the write idempotent server-side, because nothing there reads it.
8. Spawning side tasks - the runtime owns the scheduler. The one exception is a source that listens rather than polls and must own its listener (see [Concurrency](#concurrency) and the STOP list); it owes an explicit shutdown in the last `close()` that awaits its tasks.

## Tests

Mandatory four canonical source state tests (see [connector-testing](../connector-testing/SKILL.md) for the full pattern). Copy from `sources/random_source/src/lib.rs::tests`. Plus config defaults, payload building, schema selection.

Integration tests under `core/integration/tests/connectors/<backend>/` for any source backed by external infra. Use `#[iggy_harness]` + a `TestFixture` backed by `testcontainers-modules`. Reference: `core/integration/tests/connectors/postgres/postgres_source.rs` (multi-mode tests) + `restart.rs` (state survives restart). Exercise both ACK and NACK paths when the source stages cursors or destructive work.

## Before declaring done

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo sort --no-format --workspace
cargo clippy -p iggy_connector_<name>_source --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p iggy_connector_<name>_source

# Integration tests:
cargo test -p integration -- connectors::<backend>::<test_name>
```

Update `core/connectors/sources/README.md` and add a sample TOML under `core/connectors/runtime/example_config/connectors/`.
