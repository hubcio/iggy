# Go SDK for Iggy

Official Go client SDK for [Apache Iggy](https://iggy.apache.org) message streaming.

The client speaks the VSR wire protocol over TCP, with or without TLS, in a
blocking implementation. VSR is the only protocol it supports.

## Installation

The current source requires Go 1.25 or newer. From your application module,
install a release compatible with your server:

```bash
go get github.com/apache/iggy/foreign/go
```

Unversioned `go get` does not automatically select prereleases. VSR edge
versions are available, for example `v0.9.0-edge.6`. For unreleased changes,
build both SDK and server from the same checkout; `examples/go/go.mod`
replaces this module with the local SDK source.

## Running a server

From the repository root, build and start a VSR server using a new,
disposable data directory. The root environment variables bootstrap a new
instance; they do not replace credentials recovered from disk or peers:

```bash
cargo build --bin iggy-server

IGGY_PATH=/tmp/iggy-go \
IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8090 \
IGGY_HTTP_ENABLED=false IGGY_QUIC_ENABLED=false IGGY_WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=false \
IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy \
target/debug/iggy-server
```

QUIC, WebSocket and HTTP are enabled by default on ports 8080, 8092 and 3000.
Disable the ones you do not need so they cannot race with another process.

## Delivery semantics

`SendMessages` returns any placements the server reports. A send whose reply
is lost to a dropped connection returns `ErrDisconnected` without a replay.
A reconnect registers a new client identity, so a caller retry can append
the batch twice. Consumers must handle duplicates through idempotent
processing or application-level deduplication.

Crash durability follows the topic's `durability` policy: `replicated`
confirms replication, while `persisted` also waits for the required replicas
to persist the message data. An empty confirmation list is a valid success
but does not by itself prove that new messages were appended.

## Testing

Unit tests need nothing running:

```bash
go test ./...
```

The end-to-end suite runs against a server at the address in
`IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS` and skips when that variable is unset:

```bash
IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8090 go test ./tests
```

Add `IGGY_TCP_TLS_ENABLED=true` to run the TLS cases against a server started
with `IGGY_TCP_TLS_ENABLED=true` and the certificate pair in `core/certs`.
